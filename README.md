# XC3

Xgrid Cloud Cost Control is a cloud agnostic and risk free package offering powered by Cloud Custodian that provides security enforcement, tagging, unused or invalid resources cleanup, account maintenance, cost control, and backups. It supports managing AWS public cloud environments and provides a visualization of usage of resources in account with support of managing resource utilization on a click. It spins up automation scripts and triggers lambdas to control cost of running resources in aws accounts and maintain state of each resource on which action performed having real-time visibility into who made what changes from where, enables us to detect misconfigurations and non-compliance. It supports rollback plans to prevent risks from materializing. Cloud Cost Control supports conditional policy execution. It generates reports, region vise and maintains state as well.

Check the below video for a quick demo of XC3.

## Features

- One platform to track all your cloud resources be it cloud, multi-cloud, or hybrid infrastructure. It can track GCP, Azure, and AWS resources on a single UI.

- Enforces Tagging compliance that plays a vital role in determining the resources cost and many other aspects as well

- Provides Scheduled monitoring and alerting workflow that helps to track resource utilization and take action immediately.

- Provides cost optimization recommendation workflow without exposing your private information

# To start using XC3

## Requirements

---

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 1.0+
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads) 3.9
- [AWScli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)
- [Cloud Custodian](https://cloudcustodian.io/docs/quickstart/index.html#install-cloud-custodian)
- [Prometheus/Grafana/Pushgateway](https://github.com/Einsteinish/Docker-Compose-Prometheus-and-Grafana.git)
- [checkov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov) 2.0.574 or later
- [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) 0.7.1 or later

## Pre-requisites

---

1. Clone GitHub repo
   ` git clone https://github.com/XgridInc/xc3.git`
2. An AWS user with specific permission set user access.

   Refer the IAM Permission Set created in `pre_requirement` folder to setup XC3.

3. VPC needs to be present in the master account where you want to set up XC3


4. To store terraform state and maintaing lock, S3 bucket and dynamodb should be available in master account.

5. ACM certificate should be available. It will be associated with loadbalanacer and domain.

6. The user has to **enable CostExplorer** by following the below link.

   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/ce-enable.html

   ```
   Note: After enabling CE, it may take up to 24hours for AWS to start capturing your AWS account cost data, hence XC3 may not show the data until CE data is available in AWS account
   ```

# Deployment

1.  Clone the GitHub repository in your local computer to setup XC3 infrastructure.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/XgridInc/xc3.git
    ```

2. Go to the directory xc3/ and configure the input.sh file and run the below command
    ```
    cd xc3/

        Note :
            - Configure the input.sh file in directory xc3/

               namespace="example"
               project="example"
               region="eu-west-1"
               allow_traffic="0.0.0.0/0"
               domain="" #  [Optional] - If you want to use your own domain then set this variable.
               account_id="123456789012"
               hosted_zone_id="Z053166920YP1STI0EK5X"
               owner_email="admin@example.co"
               creator_email="admin@example.co"
               ses_email_address="admin@example.co"

            - Before running the below mentioned command:

    bash init.sh
    ```

3. Wait for few minutes before proceeding further for the application to come online.
    Verify the readiness of the metrics system. Load the Grafana URL in a browser. Live Grafana UI ensures the system is ready to accept and visualize metrics.


    > Verify the readiness of metrics system by accessing Grafana UI: https://xc3.xxx.com/login

    > Verify the readiness of metrics system by accessing Grafana UI: `loadbalancer-dns`. If Hosted zone ID is not provided in `input.tfvars`.



4. Now setup is complete. If domain is provided in the input.sh then users needs to be added in Cognito pool with requested role (admin/editor/viewer) in respective cognito group. User get random username/password from cognito then you can set password on domain by sign in using random credentials.

5. SSH into the private instance using EIC Endpoint to check if eveything is working fine. Here replace [instance-id] needs to be replaced with ID
         
         ssh ubuntu@[instance-id] -i keypair.pem -o ProxyCommand='aws ec2-instance-connect open-tunnel --instance-id %h'

6. Now XC3 will run at 05:00AM UTC every day to generate data and populate Grafana. Few lambdas (Total Account Cost and Project spend) will run twice in a month.

        Note :
            1. If data is not available in Grafana UI then follow the troubleshooting guide at the last section of this page.

# Troubleshooting Guide

case 1: If data is not showing into Grafana UI, there could be several reasons as shown below.

1. If AWS account was created freshly within last 24 hours then, you need to enable CostExplorer by following below link

   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/ce-enable.html

2. If the AWS account was created freshly within the last 24 hours then, it may take up to 24 hours for the AWS team to generate cost information in your account.
   you may see below error in lambda logs in Cloudwatch

   [ERROR] DataUnavailableException: An error occurred (DataUnavailableException) when calling the GetCostAndUsage operation: Data is not available. Please try to adjust the time period. If just enabled Cost Explorer, data might not be ingested yet

3. XC3 Budget Detail/IAM Role/User Workflow lambda may have failed to execute , please check Cloudwatch logs to address the issue.

case 2: user not able to change/update/modify default dashboards in Grafana UI

1.  You can't change/update default dashboards.
2.  If you need to make changes, please request for access for Editor/Admin role on
