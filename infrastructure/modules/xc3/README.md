# Terraform XC3 Module

The Terraform XC3 Module is used to create the required infrastructure of XC3. It includes the creation of EC2 insatances, IAM role that will be associated with EC2 instance, EC2 key pair, IAM instance profile, SNS topic, SQS queue, SES email identity, S3 bucket and lambda layer.
The module also allows the user to define custom tags and namespace for the resources created.

### Usage
The XC3 Module can be used by calling the module block and passing the required input variables in `main.tf`, as shown below:
```
module "xc3" {
  source = "./modules/xc3"
  sqs_queue = "notification-queue"
  ses_email_address = "admin@example.co"
  vpc_id            = "vpc-0123456789abcdef0"
  public_subnet_IDs  = ["subnet-0123456789abcdef0"]
  subnet_id = "subnet-0123456789abcdef1"
  namespace                 = "myproject"
  tags = {
    "Project" = "example"
    "Owner"       = "JohnDoe@example.co"
  }
}

```

- aws_iam_role: The IAM role that will be associated with EC2 instance.

- aws_ses_email_identity: The SES email identity to be verified for alerting in cloud custodian.

- aws_sqs_queue: The SQS queue to poll messages for alerting and notification.

- aws_sns_topic: The SNS topic for subscription of messages from lambda function.

- aws_s3_bucket: The S3 bucket for artifacts.

- aws_lambda_layer_version: The lambda layer for prometheus client that will be used in lambda functions.

- aws_lb: The AWS loadbalancer that will be used to route traffic to private EC2 instance where grafana/prometheus installed.
