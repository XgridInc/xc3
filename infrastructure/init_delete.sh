# This script is used to delete AWS resources created by a init.sh script.
# It uses a configuration file 'config.sh' to retrieve the names and ARNs of the resources to delete.
# The configuration file should define the following variables:
# - aws_region: the AWS region where the resources were created.
# - dynamo_table_name: the name of the DynamoDB table to delete.
# - bucket_name: the name of the S3 bucket to delete.
# - namespace: the namespace used to create the resources.
# - Domain: the domain name used to create the ACM certificate.
# - owner_email: the email address of the owner of the team.
# - creator_email: the email address of the creator who spin up the resources.
